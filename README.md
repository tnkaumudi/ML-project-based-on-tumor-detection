# ML-project-based-on-tumor-detection
To build a Machine Learning Classification model that can classify from a given set of features, if the cancer is Benign or Malignant.
Random forest, like its name implies, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forestspits out a class prediction and the class with
the most votes becomes our modelâ€™s prediction. Achieved accuracy is 95.2%.
